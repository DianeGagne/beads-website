# beads-website

This is a project to get comfortable with Vue.

Bead website uses a populated set of seed beads as a palette to create bead patterns (like pixel art) in multiple different shapes.  It uses a canvas to draw on with the pre set squares of the beads.

This project was created using Laravel Homestead as a base platform.
